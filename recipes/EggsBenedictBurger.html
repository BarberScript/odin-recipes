    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>4 English muffins, split and toasted</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>8 slices Canadian bacon</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Instructions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape them into patties. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes per side or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the hollandaise sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk the melted butter into the egg yolk mixture, pouring it in a thin stream while whisking continuously. Continue whisking until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another skillet, cook the Canadian bacon slices until they are heated through.</li>
        <li>In a separate non-stick skillet, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are cooking, mix together the mayonnaise and chopped fresh chives in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread the chive mayonnaise on the toasted English muffin halves.</li>
        <li>Place a cooked beef patty on the bottom half of each English muffin.</li>
        <li>Top each patty with a slice of Canadian bacon, a slice of American cheese, and a poached egg.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs.</li>
        <li>Close the burgers with the top halves of the English muffins.</li>
        <li>Serve the Eggs Benedict Burgers immediately and enjoy!</li>
